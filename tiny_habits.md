# Tiny Habits

## Tiny Habits Concept

- **BJ Fogg's idea:** Introduce "tiny habits" - small, easy-to-do changes in behavior.

## Behavior Change Equation (B = MAP)

- **B = MAP:** Behavior = Motivation + Ability + Prompt.
- **Motivation (M):**
  - Desire or energy to perform a behavior.
  - Emotional or psychological drive.
  - High motivation needed for more difficult behaviors.
  
- **Ability (A):**
  - Ease with which a behavior can be performed.
  - Simplicity and feasibility.
  - Fogg emphasizes making behavior easier.

- **Prompt (P):**
  - Cue or trigger initiating the behavior.
  - External (e.g., alarm), internal (thought or emotion), or action prompt.

## Applying B = MAP to Make Habits Easier

1. **Shrink the Behavior:**
   - Make behavior small and simple (30 seconds or less).
  
2. **Identify an Action Prompt:**
   - Use completion of one behavior as a trigger for the next.

3. **Celebrate (Shine):**
   - Celebrate completion of tiny habit for positive reinforcement.

## Importance of "Shine"

- **Positive Reinforcement:**
  - Celebrating acts as positive reinforcement.
  - Strengthens neural pathways associated with the habit.

- **Emotional Connection:**
  - Celebrating creates a positive emotional connection.
  - Transforms habit from mundane to joy, increasing likelihood of regularity.

- **Building Confidence and Motivation:**
  - Success breeds confidence.
  - Sense of accomplishment boosts motivation.

- **Success Momentum:**
  - Consistent celebration creates success momentum.
  - Propels forward, making it easier to tackle more challenging habits.

# 1% Better Every Day

## Power of 1% Improvement

- Small improvements, even 1% each day, lead to remarkable results.
- Improvement by 1% each day for a year results in being 37 times better.

## Importance of Habits

- Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement.
- Good habits make time your ally, while bad habits make time your enemy.

## Four Stages of Habit Formation

1. **Noticing:** Awareness of something.
2. **Wanting:** Desire or craving for the habit.
3. **Doing:** Actual performance of the habit.
4. **Liking:** Enjoying the reward to reinforce the habit.

## Implementation Intentions

- Specific plans and implementation intentions significantly increase the odds of success.
- Clear plans reduce reliance on motivation and willpower.

## Making Better Choices Easier

- Design your environment to put more steps between you and bad behaviors and fewer steps between you and good behaviors.
